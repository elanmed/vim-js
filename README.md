# vim-js

My take on a minimalist [vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium)

### Keymaps

- `<C-d>` Scroll down by a half-page
- `<C-u>` Scroll up by a half-page
- `G` Scroll to the bottom of the page
- `gg` Scroll to the top of the page
- `yy` Yank the current URL to the clipboard
- `<C-^>` Switch to the previous tab
- `<C-h>` Switch to the tab to the right
- `<C-l>` Switch to the tab to the left
- `L` Switch to the rightmost tab
- `H` Switch to the leftmost tab
- `s` TODO Initiate [seek](https://github.com/elanmed/seek.nvim)

> Note that control key remaps need to be set in chrome://extensions/shortcuts
