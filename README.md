# vim-js

My take on a minimalist [vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium)

### Keymaps

- `j` Scroll down by a half-page
- `k` Scroll up by a half-page
- `G` Scroll to the bottom of the page
- `gg` Scroll to the top of the page
- `yy` Yank the current URL to the clipboard
- `^` TODO Visit the last tab
- `s` TODO Initiate [seek](https://github.com/elanmed/seek.nvim)
